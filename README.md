Implementation of algorithms used in numerical optimization for ML and DS
In this course i have studied and implemented alot of numerical algorithms used in ML & DL models training
some of this algorithms: 
  1-Gradient decents and its variants(Batch - mini batch - stochastic) 
  2- Momentum Based GD
  3- Nesetrov Accelerated GD (NAG)  
  4- Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad)
  5- RMS Prop
  6- Adaptive Momentum (ADAM)
